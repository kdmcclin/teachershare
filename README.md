#TeacherShare
============

TeacherShare was built as a 24 hr project during the sixth week of [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/)

It is built using Ruby on Sinatra.  If you're using Windows you may need to start the server with 
```
thin -R config.ru start
```
or, if you've activated a more recent version of rack
```
bundle exec thin -R config.ru start
```
